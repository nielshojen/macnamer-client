## Deploying to clients
Installation is simple, install the package using your favourite method, and then set the preference to point to the ServerURL. You can use MCX, Profiles, or 
plain old defaults write:

	defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.nielshojen.macnamer ServerURL "http://macnamer.yourserver.com"

## Acknowledgements
This project was originally started by Graham Gilbert, so all kudos go to him. This project is just to keep this alive as long as i need it, and the change of pref domain is just to keep the two separate.
